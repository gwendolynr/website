abstract = "Background: Routine annual influenza vaccinations are recommended
for persons 6 months of age and older, but less than half of
US adults get vaccinated. Many employers offer employees free
influenza vaccinations at workplace clinics, but even then take-up is
low.
Objective: To determine whether employees are significantly more
likely to get vaccinated if they have a higher probability of walking
by the clinic for reasons other than vaccination.
Method: We obtained data from an employer with a free workplace
influenza vaccination clinic. Using each employee’s building entry/
exit swipe card data, we test whether functional proximity—the
likelihood that the employee walks by the clinic for reasons other
than vaccination—predicts whether the employee gets vaccinated at
the clinic. We also test whether base proximity—the inverse of
walking distance from the employee’s desk to the clinic—predicts
vaccination probability.
Participants: A total of 1801 employees of a health benefits administrator
that held a free workplace influenza vaccination clinic.
Results: A 2 SD increase in functional proximity is associated with
a 6.4 percentage point increase in the probability of vaccination
(total vaccination rate at company = 40%), even though the average
employee’s desk is only 166 meters from the clinic. Base proximity
does not predict vaccination probability.
Conclusions and Relevance: Minor changes in the environment
can have substantial effects on the probability of vaccination. If
these results generalize, health systems should emphasize functional
proximity over base proximity when locating preventive health
services.
Key Words: vaccination, clinics, workplace wellness, proximity,
preventive care, influenza"
