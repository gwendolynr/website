Objectives—To assess whether the addition of a peer testimonial to an informational mailing
increases conversion rates from brand-name prescription medications to lower-cost therapeutic
equivalents, and whether the testimonial’s efficacy increases when information is added about an
affiliation the quoted individual shares with the recipient.
Research Design and Methods—5,498 union members were randomly assigned to receive
one of three different informational letters: one without a testimonial (No Testimonial Group), onewith a testimonial from a person whose shared union affiliation with the recipient was not
disclosed (Unaffiliated Testimonial Group), and one with a testimonial from a person whose
shared union affiliation with the recipient was disclosed (Affiliated Testimonial Group).
Results—The conversion rate for the No Testimonial Group was 12.2%, which is higher than the
Unaffiliated Testimonial Group rate of 11.3% and the Affiliated Testimonial Group rate of 11.7%.
The differences between the groups are not statistically significant.
Conclusions—Short peer testimonials do not increase the impact of a mailed communication on
conversion rates to lower-cost, therapeutically equivalent medications, even when the testimonial is presented as coming from a more socially proximate peer"
