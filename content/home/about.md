# Biography

I am a Director of Data Science at the Sorenson Impact Center, an applied academic institution at the University of Utah. My job is to help non-profits, philanthropists, and governments use data to address social problems. We conduct evaluations, collect and analyze data, create dashboards, and run statistical models (when we're lucky). (The opinions reflected on this blog are my own and do not represent the Sorenson Impact Center or the University of Utah.)

Before I moved to the desert, I lived in Cambridge and worked as a Research Director for the largest bi-partisan economics think tank in the country (NBER). I have always sought to understand why humans behave the way they do, and that curiousity led me to data science.
